# WeatherApp

In this project, I learn how to use API by creating a weather app by utilizing **OpenWeatherMap API** and **Pexels API**.

## OpenWeatherMap API Usage
I have used openweathermap API to fetch the weather data of the city name entered by users.

## Pexels API
I have used Pexels API to fetch the image of the city name entered by the users as a background image if available, otherwise a default image is already present.


## How to Use the Weather App
1. Visit the link: https://abhisheksagarin.github.io/WeatherApp/
2. Enter the city name of which you want to check the weather data about.
3. Hit Enter or click on the search button to see the results.

If you enjoyed using the app, liked my work, and want to collaborate for some project, you can reach out to me at: abhishek@epikdeveloper.com or mail@abhisheksagar.in
